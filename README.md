I've scraped every frame of the launch, starting at the first frame showing T-10:00:00, and ending after Starship loses telemetry.

The telemetry here is unedited. Propellant levels were estimated from the webcasts' propellant bars, and aren't very accurate. Speed, altitude, and engine counts are mostly accurate---most errors are in Starship telemetry before stage separation, as the graphics were faded then, and after Booster RUD for the same reasons.
